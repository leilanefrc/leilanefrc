## Hello, world!

👋 My name is Leilane (@leilanefrc).

👩🏻‍💻 I am a Macroeconomist, with a PhD in Economics from the University of Surrey.

💻 I am a self-taught programmer who enjoys using code to solve problems. I have experience using MATLAB, R, and Python. I have also already used SQL, PHP, HTML, CSS and (a tiny bit of) C#. Currently, I have been learning JavaScript in my free time.

🔍 You can also find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leilanecambara/).
