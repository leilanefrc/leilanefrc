## Hello, world!

👋 My name is Leilane (@leilanefrc).

👩🏻‍💻 I am a data analyst with 7+ years of experience in using data, statistics and mathematical models to answer research questions.

💻 I am a self-taught programmer who enjoys using code to solve problems. I have experience using **R**, **Python**, **SQL** and MATLAB to work with data. I have also already used PHP, HTML, CSS and (a tiny bit of) C#. Currently, I have been learning JavaScript in my free time.

🔍 You can also find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leilanecambara/).
